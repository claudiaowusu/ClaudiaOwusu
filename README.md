## Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Claudia

I'm a Data Analyst. My name is Claudia Owusu. I am a data analyst with a background in teaching and psychology. 
My journey into data analytics began in an unexpected place, the classroom. As a teacher, I spent years not just instructing students, but also analyzing their performance data to understand learning gaps, track progress, and tailor interventions. I became fascinated by the patterns in the numbers, the stories they told about student behavior, and how I could use those insights to improve outcomes. Over time, I realized my true passion was in uncovering insights and using data to solve problems.
